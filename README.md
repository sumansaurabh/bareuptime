> **Enterprise-grade uptime monitoring at startup prices** - Monitor your websites and APIs with 99.9% reliability for just $50/year instead of $360+/year from competitors.

## 🤔 Why BareUptime?

Traditional uptime monitoring tools are **ridiculously overpriced**. All we really need is a system that answers two simple questions:

1. **Is my website/API up?** 
2. **Can it notify me immediately** — on mobile, Slack, Discord, or email?

That's it. We don't need fancy animated dashboards or enterprise sales calls.

### The Problem with Current Solutions

Most tools gate essential features behind expensive paywalls:
- 📱 **Mobile push notifications?** *Premium - $20/month*
- 🔗 **API access/Webhooks?** *Premium - $10/month* 
- 🌍 **Global monitoring?** *Premium - $15/month*
- 🔒 **SSL monitoring?** *Premium - $10/month*

**Total: $360+/year** for features that cost pennies to run.
